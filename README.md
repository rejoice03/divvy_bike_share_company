# Divvy Bike Share Company


## BACKGROUND

Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing program which features more than 5,800 
bikes and 600 docking stations. It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo 
bikes, making it more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a 
standard two-wheeled bike. It was founded in 2016 and has grown tremendously into a 
fleet of bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across 
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station 
in the system anytime.

Previously, Cyclistic's marketing strategy tried to build the general awareness and 
appeal to broad consumers. It has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, 
full-day passes, and annual memberships. Those who purchase single-ride or full-day 
passes are referred to as casual riders while those who purchase annual memberships are 
Cyclistic members.

Overall Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual 
members.

Business Question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes 
differently?"

### BUSINESS SUGGESTIONS

1. Personalize discounts and show perks in the membership program based on their 
preferences and riding habits.

2. Emphasize the benefits of memberships, including discounts during busy times of the 
year like during Summer, or on the weekends.

3. Have existing members to share their stories about how using Cyclistic's system has 
changed their life, to create a sense of community, offer a discount if they do so this 
will help encourage new riders to join the program.
